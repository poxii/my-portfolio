            Hi, everyone, I'm James Gates. I'm full-stack developer and software development expert.
            <br />
            <br />I have 5+ years' experience for web development. During last years, I had earned many skills to
            develop and manage a website and it now helps for a new project to develop in a high quality, rapidly.
            <br />
            <br />I like to work with a simple communication, a clean and optimized code convention, a high quality
            development for collaboration and maintenance, and a keeping schedules for a project. I also love learning a
            new thing from analyzing, discussing and resolving variable claims.
          </p>
